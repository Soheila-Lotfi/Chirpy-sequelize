    * The `'chirp'` table includes a field for id, author, chirp, and time created.
    * Create connection.js to connect to database using sequelize package.
    * Create a `'chirp'` model  that matches up with DB. 
    * Create a public folder to hold html, css and javascript files.
    * Create the api-routes.js file so that there is a route for adding a new chirp, as well as retrieving all chirps.
